The folder ‘Cell Attributes’ contains 5 CSV files: ‘Initial’, ‘Buildings’, ‘DefensibleSpace’, ‘Vegetation’, and ‘IWUIC’. 
Each file has six rows, with each row representing a different type of land cover 
(1. Grasses, 2. Forest, 3. Residential Neighborhoods, 4. Commercial Buildings, 5. Roads, and 6. Highways). 
Each file has five columns, with each column representing a different parameter for our wildfire model. 
The first column gives the key for each land cover type, the second column gives a range of values for p(ignition | adjacent square on fire), 
the third column gives a range of the estimated property value in dollars per square, the fourth column gives a range of lives per square, 
and the fifth gives a normalized range of the relative initial fuel load per square.
