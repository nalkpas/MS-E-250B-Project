The folder ‘Cell Attributes’ contains 5 CSV files: ‘Initial’, ‘Buildings’, ‘DefensibleSpace’, ‘Vegetation’, and ‘IWUIC’. Each file has six rows, with each row representing a different type of land cover (1. Grasses, 2. Forest, 3. Residential Neighborhoods, 4. Commercial Buildings, 5. Roads, and 6. Highways). Each file has five columns, with each column representing a different parameter for our wildfire model. The first column gives the key for each land cover type, the second column gives values for p(ignition | adjacent square on fire), the third column gives a relative property value, the fourth column gives a relative lives value, and the fifth gives a normalized measurement of the relative initial fuel load.
